_Inspired by Dave Bollinger's [pixel spaceships](http://davebollinger.org/works/pixelspaceships/)._

Fun program I created for sprite generation â€” mostly in the span of a few days. It's kind-of almost usable, just needs a bit of work to become user-friendly. The most exciting feature is the animation. For this I created a special move tool which lets you move a specific pixel while keeping its state.

## Features
- Draw template for sprite generation
- HSL color range picker
- **Frame Animation**
- X/Y mirroring
